                <p>This book provides an introduction to Galileo. In a startling reinterpretation of Galileo's trial, Stillman Drake advances the hypothesis that Galileo's prosecution and condemnation by the Inquisition was caused not by his defiance of the Church but by the hostility of contemporary philosophers. Galileo's own beautifully lucid arguments are used in this volume to show how his scientific method was utterly divorced from the Aristotelian approach to physics; it was based on a search not for causes but for laws. </p>
                <p>Galileo's methods had an overwhelming significance for the development of modern physics, and they led to a final parting of the ways between science and philosophy. Now, in this extraordinary and concise introduction, Drake provides a stimulating view of Galileo's life and works, providing a fresh perspective on Galileo's methodology and his final incrimination.</p>

introducing them to the mathematical sciences, has by long experience taught me that not 
entirely improper was the request of that royal pupil who sought from Archimedes, as his 
teacher of geometry, an easier and more open road that would lead him to its possession; for 
even in our age very few can patiently travel the steep and thorny path along which one must 
first pass before acquiring the precious fruits of this science.... Hence I excuse them [who 
cannot take the long path] together with that young King of Syracuse, and desiring that they 
should not remain deprived of knowledge so necessary to noble gentlemen by reason of the 
length and difficulty of ordinary roads, I fell to trying to open this truly royal road‚Äîfor with the 
aid of my Compass I do that in a few days, teaching everything derived from geometry and 
arithmetic for civil and military use that is ordinarily received only by very long studies.‚Äù</td>

against Capra and remaining copies of the book were confiscated. 30 copies escaped, so

spherical solid, but is marked by an uneven, rough, and very sinuous line, as the figure 
shows.... what causes even greater wonder is that very many bright points appear within the 
dark part of the Moon... gradually these are increased in size and brightness [and...] joined 
with the rest of the bright part.... Now, on Earth, before sunrise, aren‚Äôt the peaks of the highest

contrary to the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner‚Äôs view that they are planets circling the Sun like 
Venus. Not planets because: they move together, and slowly (about a month). They are 
irregular in shape. They form and disappear with irregular timing. Foreshortening of the spots 
as they approach the edge of the solar disk proves they're contiguous with the solar surface.

e.g. Bellarmine. Diagrams of periods of Jupiter, phases of Venus. Explicit affirmation of 
Copernicanism. Priority dispute, and witty, patronizing invective alienated Scheiner:

how the heavens go; Scripture never errs, but its interpreters do err; and read rightly, 
Scripture and Science will never conflict (unity of truth). That which is obscure (figurative 
language) should be explained by means of that which is clear (mathematics). To show the 
traditional basis of his exegesis, he cited St. Augustine throughout. While theologians were 
not impressed by a mathematician trying his hand at exegesis, Galileo actually did exegesis 
better than the theologians did physics. Pope John Paul II used Galilean language to affirm 
similar hermeneutical principles in 1992.
